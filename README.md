# Python-PROJECT-A4---Drug-consumption

Personality Traits and Drug Consumption Analysis
Project Description
This project aims to explore the relationship between personality traits and drug consumption. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of an individual's drug consumption during their lifetime based on their personality traits.
Background
Drug consumption is a significant public health issue. Understanding the contributing factors, including personality traits, is essential for prevention and treatment efforts.
Data Used
•	The main dataset includes data on personality traits and drug consumption of various individuals.
•	Link to the dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified
Classify type of drug consumer by personality data
•	Dataset Characteristics: Multivariate
•	Subject Area: Social Science
•	Associated Tasks: Classification
•	Feature Type: Real
•	# Instances: 1885
Methodology
•	Conduct an exploratory data analysis to identify trends and correlations.
•	Clean and prepare the data for processing.
•	Apply machine learning models to predict drug consumption.
•	Evaluate the performance of the models.
Technologies Used
•	Python
•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc.
