# Python-PROJECT-A4 - Drug Consumption Analysis

## Personality Traits and Drug Consumption Analysis

### Project Description

This project aims to explore the relationship between personality traits and drug consumption. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of an individual's drug consumption during their lifetime based on their personality traits.

### Background

Drug consumption is a significant public health issue. Understanding the contributing factors, including personality traits, is essential for prevention and treatment efforts.

### Data Used

- The main dataset includes data on personality traits and drug consumption of various individuals.
- Link to the dataset: [Drug Consumption Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified)

#### Classify Type of Drug Consumer by Personality Data

- Dataset Characteristics: Multivariate
- Subject Area: Social Science
- Associated Tasks: Classification
- Feature Type: Real
- Instances: 1885

### Methodology

- Conduct an exploratory data analysis to identify trends and correlations.
- Clean and prepare the data for processing.
- Apply machine learning models to predict drug consumption.
- Evaluate the performance of the models.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc.
